      <h2>Bears</h2>
      <p style="width: 500px">
        Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified
        as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of
        bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of
        habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the
        Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America,
        South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears
        include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears,
        shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short
        tails.

      <h2>Giraffes</h2>
      <p style="width: 500px">
        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
        Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
        ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one
        species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
        researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new
        research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual
        species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other
        extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

      <h2>Lions</h2>
      <p style="width: 500px">
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to
        Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
        rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.
        It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
        have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
        prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
        and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
        on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
        predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
        been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
        prey on humans.

      <h2>Monkeys</h2>
      <p style="width: 500px">
        Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder
        Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the
        group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus
        monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping;
        however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are
        also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard
        to their scope.

      <h2>Alligators</h2>
      <p style="width: 500px">
        An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus
        Alligator of the family Alligatoridae of the order Crocodilia. The two
        extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the
        Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several extinct species
        of alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first appeared
        during the late Eocene epoch about 37 million years ago.
